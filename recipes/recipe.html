    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a completely unpretentious, down-home macaroni and cheese recipe just like my grandma and mom always made. A simple white sauce where you add cheese and a few other flavors with macaroni and a potato chip crust. This recipe makes a lot, I like to make two pans so I can take one to a pot luck and have the other one to keep in the fridge for later. It's an easy recipe to adjust down if you only want to make one pan. If you aren't cooking it right away, just keep the topping separate until you are ready to put it in the oven. </p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 ¾ pounds whole-wheat macaroni</li>
        <li>¾ cup butter</li>
        <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>6 cups milk, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mustard powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>3 (8 ounce) packages shredded American cheese</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) bag potato chips (such as Lay's®), crushed</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>butter-flavored cooking spray</li>
    </ul>


    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium-low heat. Slowly add flour to butter, whisking constantly; cook until brown and the mixture no longer smells of flour, about 5 minutes. Pour 1 cup milk into the flour mixture, whisking continually until fully incorporated, about 45 seconds; repeat twice. Add remaining 3 cups milk to the mixture, whisking to incorporate. Stir Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper into the mixture; season with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low. Cook sauce, whisking frequently, until it begins to thicken, about 10 minutes. Add about half the package of shredded Cheddar cheese; stir continually until the cheese melts completely. Repeat with remaining half package of Cheddar cheese and the American cheese, about 4 ounces at a time. Once cheese is entirely incorporated, remove sauce from heat.
        </li>
        <li>Stir drained macaroni into the cheese sauce to coat. Divide macaroni between two 9x13-inch baking dishes.</li>
        <li>Mix crushed potato chips, 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, and Parmesan cheese in a bowl. Top the macaroni with the potato chip mixture evenly. Spray the potato chip mixture with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the sauce is bubbling, 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup cold water</li>
        <li>½ cup uncooked long grain white rice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>6 medium green bell peppers</li>
        <li>16 ounces tomato sauce, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    </ul>


    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients, and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a covered saucepan. Reduce heat to low and simmer until rice is tender, about 20 minutes.</li>

        <li>Hollow out bell peppers by removing and discarding the tops, seeds, and membranes. Slice the bottoms of the peppers if necessary to make sure they stand up straight.
        </li>
        <li>Arrange peppers in a baking dish with the hollowed sides facing upward.</li>
        <li>Prepare filling by mixing cooked beef, cooked rice, 1/2 of the tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Spoon an equal amount of filling into each hollowed pepper.</li>
        <li>Mix remaining tomato sauce and Italian seasoning in a bowl, and pour over the stuffed peppers.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, basting with sauce every 15 minutes, until peppers are tender, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
